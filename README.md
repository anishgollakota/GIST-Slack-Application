# Text-Summarization-SlackBot
Developed an extractive text summarization tool to simplify long conversations between users along with the ability to gauge the sentiment of the user. Helps solve the problem of reading long groups of messages and being able to get the gist of the user in conversation.

## Note
In order to quickstart the use of this tool, an easy way is to use an NGROK pipeline to communicate between the script and Slack server.

## Example

- Many PMs and employees limited on time, don't have the ability to read lengthy information on Slack, looking for the ability to simply get a Gist of it.
